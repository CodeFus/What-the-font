                Sometimes, all I think about is <span>you</span><br>
                Late nights in the middle of <span>June</span><br>
                Heat waves been fakin' me <span>out</span><br>
                Can't make you happier <span>now</span><br>
                Sometimes, all I think about is <span>you</span><br>
                Late nights in the middle of <span>June</span><br>
                Heat waves been fakin' me <span>out</span><br>
                Can't make you happier <span>now</span><br> <br><br>
                <span class="one">Usually</span> I put somethin' on <span class="one">TV</span> <br>
                So we <span id="two">never</span> think about you and <span class="one">me</span> <br>
                But today I see our reflections<br>
                Clearly in <span>Hollywood</span>, layin' on the screen<br>
                You just need a better life than <span class="one">this</span><br>
                You need somethin' I can never <span class="one">give</span><br>
                Fake water all across the <span class="one">one</span><br>
                It's gone now, the night has come, but<br><br> <br><br>
                Sometimes, all I think about is <span>you</span><br>
                Late nights in the middle of <span>June</span><br>
                Heat waves been fakin' me <span>out</span><br>
                Can't make you happier <span>now</span><br> <br><br>
                You can't fight <span class="two">it</span>, you can't <span class="two">breathe</span> <br>
                You say something so <span class="three">lovin'</span>, but <br>
                Now I gotta let you go <br>
                You'll be better off in someone new <br>
                I don't wanna be alone <br>
                You know it hurts me too <br>
                You look so broken when you cry <br>
                One more and then I say goodbye <br> <br><br>
                <span class="low-voice">
                I just wonder what you're dreamin' of <br>
                When you sleep and smile so comfortable <br>
                I just wish that I could give you that <br>
                That look that's perfectly un-sad <br>
                </span><br> <br><br>
                <p id="last-part">
                Road shimmer wigglin' the vision <br>
                Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror <br>
                Road shimmer wigglin' the vision <br>
                Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror <br>
                <br><br><br>
                </p>
